## Description

* Equim's HTML/CSS/JS practice zone. Link: http://equimcute.com

## TODO

* Wrap and migrate [DateCalc](https://github.com/Equim-chan/DateCalc) to DateCalc branch.
* Check the rest TODOs in [master/index.html](https://github.com/Equim-chan/equim-chan.github.io/blob/master/index.html).

## Trivia

* __"A page that is always under construction."__  
You may see this sentence in the "description" part of the meta. Sentences with similar meaning can also be seen in some inconspicuous part of this page.  
The reason why I wrote this is I think knowledge is infinite. The more ideas I want to implement, the more techniques I need to learn; the more technique I have learned, the more ideas I will come up with. Hence this page will never be completed.  
Maybe someday when I add more branches with the content and features of the site enriched, the "under construction" sign will be temporarily removed.
* __"Just feel her breath~"__  
This sentence is shown when you click "More".  
The blur/zoom loop animation are presented as if the background girl was breathing. Actually such sort of loop animation is exactly called "breathing animation", and I manifested it in the literal way.
* __The B&W effect when the mouse is over the music box__  
I have to admit that it is beyond expectation.  
I failed to catch the "mousemove" event within the iframe and process it in the parent window, after a whole day of attempt on researching. However this alternative effect still presents well.
